## Description


- We wanted to build a site where searching for ideas for a night in would be fun and more focused than doing numerous searches in different browser windows for food, drinks, and entertainment. 
- We built this site to see what we could achieve in accessing recipe and entertainment APIs within a single site. We wanted to see if we could save different kinds of recipes in one place, and we wanted to see if we could turn data from API searches into dynamic content that fit the vibe of our website.
- Our website solves the problem of having scattered searches for drinks, food, and film. It enables the user to find inspiration and easily browse random recipes to see if they see something they hadn't thought of before. 
- We learned a lot about the flow of working together on one project through our local computers and sharing on Github through our main and individual branches.  We learned a lot about the techniques involved in fetching API data, and how to turn it into dynamic information on the DOM. We also learned a lot more about how to use and access data we store in localStorage in the browswer.
